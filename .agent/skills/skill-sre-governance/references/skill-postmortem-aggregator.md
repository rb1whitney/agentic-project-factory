  [SRE] To be used when you have a folder containing N Post Mortem files.
  This will help crunch data and maintain/update a POMO_AGGREGATED.md file

# CHANGELOG
#   10mar26 v0.0.1 Initial idea dump
# /CHANGELOG

# TODO -> refine this base idea
# The base idea is to do what I've done with numerous customers
# 1. Enforce a JSON/FrontMatter schema for the PostMortem, with at least date started, date ended, datetime detected, product area, and
# 2. This skill must have in input a folder with 3+ PoMos
# 3. => Crates a small graph / statistics of "How many bad minutes you had this year" and create a few graphs, and tables and document in a `pomo-statistics.md`
# TODO(ricc): ensure to patch the PoMo creator to also add a FrontMatter to make life easier here. Also add a PoMoGenerator version like 1.1 to be used later on. Damn I didn't envision cross-markdown-version-dependencies until today! :)
# TODO(ricc/Gemini): add scripts to create the CSV here, and also to create graphs with the numbers given. Script should be able to work on test data.

# Identify the PoMos

* If the pomos are local in a folder, use those.
* If they're external, create a new folder called `YYYYMMDD_POSTMORTEMS/` and copy their MD version there. This might lose information, but ensure the relevant info is transported here, locally. You could run the "postmortem generator" skill on a locally curled page.
* If there is ONE, refuse to run this.
* If there is 2-3, suggest the user it's worth using a plurality of these.

## Action

Check all the Post Mortems in the folder and identify these informations:

1. Timestamp of outage start.
1. Timestamp of outage identified by human and being worked on (if available).
1. Timestamp of first Mitigation going into place (if available)
1. Timestamp of outage end.
1. Product used (eg Cloud, Youtube). Products could have a taxonomy (eg `Cloud::GCE::PersistentDisk`, `Youtube::Playlists`)
1. RootCause class (HUMAN_ERROR, CONFIG_CHANGE, EXTERNAL_CAUSE, ..).
1. Outage size, how bad it was (TEST, NEGLIGIBLE, SMALL, MEDIUM, BIG, CATASTROPHIC).

Build a `pomo_stats.csv` with this data, one line per incident

```
filename,title,outage_start,outage_detected,outage_mitigated,outage_ended,root_cause,size
folder/20260101-millennium-bug.md,Millennium Bug hit us!,20260101-09:00:00,,,20260101-12:42:00,HUMAN_ERROR,NEGLIGIBLE
```

## Crunching the data

Once you have the CSV with raw data, you can write some simple code which does the following:

1. Decide what YOUR_DESIGNATED_FOLDER is.
1. Create or Update `POMO_AGGREGATED.md` under YOUR_DESIGNATED_FOLDER/.
1. Caculate for every incident:
   * `outage_duration` (end - start)
   * `time_to_detect` (detect - start)
   * `time_to_mitigate` (mitigate - detect).
   * `detection_rate` (ratio between time_to_detect / outage_duration ). This is indicative of how fast we're to OBSERVE an outage vs FIX it and tells us a lot about our organization.
1. Do an aggregation of all stats except detection_rate (its a percentage on varying numbers, so it's comparing watermellons to cherries).
1. Do a subjective analysis of the detection_rate.
1. Create breakdown by YEAR and PRODUCT.
1. Consider using image generation scripts to create simple graphs.

## Lessons learnt

* See recurring patterns and add a H2 paragraph on `## recurring patterns`: Is there anything we can learn from this aggregation? Is this a mistake we keep on doing? Is there a bug which looks like we're not prioritizing? Is there a number of bugs who all look like the same? This is the step where we can actually identify schemas in this plurality.
* Is there some other lesson we learn from this plurality? Write about it in the `## Conclusions`.
