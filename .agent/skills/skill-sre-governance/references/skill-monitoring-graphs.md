# 📈 Monitoring & Incident Graphing Skill 📊

This skill guides the agent through identifying high-signal metrics, extracting data efficiently, and creating professional annotated graphs.

## 🚨 DATA INTEGRITY: NEVER MAKE UP NUMBERS
- **ONLY REAL DATA:** Absolutely **NEVER** fake data, interpolate guesses, or hard-code values (like forcing a firewall block period to exactly 0) just to make a graph look "correct" or align with a narrative. 
- **The Data Is The Source Of Truth:** If there is an outage, the raw metrics or the *absence* of metrics must prove it. Show the *real* raw availability.
- **Handling Complete Blackouts:** If a full blackout causes missing data points from the API, do not invent data. Instead, use Pandas `reindex` to fill the missing continuous time intervals with 0s.

## 🚀 Workflow

### 1. Metric Selection & Efficient Extraction 🕵️‍♀️
- **Standard Time:** Always use **UTC** for all timestamps by default. 🌐
- **Performance Tip:** Cloud Monitoring can be **VERY SLOW** for high-res data. 🐢
- **Execution:**
  1. Use Monitoring MCP to find relevant metrics for the incident time window.
  2. Download the data as CSV (e.g., `out/incident/metric.csv`) or directly parse JSON.
  3. Use a sub-agent (`generalist`) for large datasets to keep the main session history lean.
- **Reference:** See [archetypes.md](references/archetypes.md) for "Apple-to-Apple" strategies and granularity tables.

### 2. Baseline Graph (Draft) 🖼️
- **Rule:** Always generate a raw "Draft" graph first to confirm the data shows a clear signal.
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  uv run ./scripts/plot_archetype.py --csv data.csv --out draft.png --title "Title"
  ```
- **Verification:** Ensure the graph is not "flat." The X-axis must explicitly show "Time (UTC)" so there is no ambiguity! 🕰️

### 3. Annotated Graph (Final) 🔴
- **Requirement:** Only proceed after the user confirms the draft is "good."
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  # Times are assumed to be UTC unless --timezone is specified
  uv run ./scripts/plot_archetype.py \
    --csv data.csv \
    --out final.png \
    --final \
    --start "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" \
    --detect "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" \
    --mitigate "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" \
    --end "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
  ```
- **Styling Guidelines (Annotations):**
  - **Red (`#d93025`):** Breakages, outages, faults, or incident start/end. Use different line thicknesses (`linewidth=1` to `3`) or styles (`:`, `--`, `-.`) to denote severity.
  - **Yellow (`#f9ab00`):** Human detection or alert triggered.
  - **Green (`#1e8e3e`):** Fix, mitigation, or resolution applied.

## 📝 Safeguards & Tips

* **Scaling Lines:** Use `--hmin` and `--hmax` to show Cloud Run/GKE scaling limits (min/max instances).
* **Auto-Coloring:** Blue for `ingress`, Green for `egress` for Network I/O.
* **Timeouts:** Use `timeout 60` for data extraction tool calls to avoid infinite loops. Also prefer MCP calls to Monitoring/Logging (faster) vs `gcloud` commands (slower).
* **Clear Timing:** Ensure that looking at the time variable allows a person to know EXACTLY what that time is. 
    * For instance, if time is 03:00 ensure the TZ is specified in the X-axis label.
    * If the graph only contains HOURS (ie, all happens within a day) and no days, then ensure the day is also written in the X-axis label.
* **Correlation in graphs**: if you need to prove a time-correlation between heterogeneous graphs (eg error logs volume vs increase in traffic) remember:
    * **Time is key** - keep a single X-axis with consistent time across the 2+ graphs.
    * Example: `assets/sample_correlation_data/improved_incident_graphs.png`
* **Revision and multiple files**. Since images are very succulent, if you create a new image do NOT overwrite the old image, rather add _rev1, _rev2, .. to the file name.
    * If an image is proven to be wrong by further investigation, do NOT delete it, rather add it to Trash/ within the original folder, and possibly rename it to why it was wrong in the filename.

## 🐍 Juicy Python Patterns (From Real Investigations)

See `scripts/reference_dual_plot.py` for a complete example of parsing JSON and plotting.

### 1. Handling Missing Data (Reindexing)
```python
# Force 0s for missing data in outages (Pandas)
full_range = pd.date_range(start=df.index.min(), end=df.index.max(), freq='1min')
df = df.reindex(full_range, fill_value=0)
```

### 2. Smoothing "Golden Signals"
```python
# 5min rolling average for smoother 'Golden Signal' look
vol_smooth = grouped['Total'].rolling(5, min_periods=1).mean().fillna(0)
avail_smooth = grouped['Availability'].rolling(5, min_periods=1).mean().fillna(0)
```

### 3. Dual Axes (Availability & Traffic)
```python
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(15, 10), sharex=True)
ax1.plot(df.index, df.avail, color='#d93025', label='Success Rate') # Top: %
ax1.fill_between(df.index, df.avail, color='#d93025', alpha=0.1)
ax2.plot(df.index, df.vol, color='#1a73e8', label='Traffic') # Bottom: Volume
ax2.fill_between(df.index, df.vol, color='#1a73e8', alpha=0.1)
```
